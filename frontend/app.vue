// just Chatbot.vue's self-contained subtree, which resolves its own scheme
// independently since it's also embeddable standalone) reacts to dark mode.
// `text-foreground`'s resolved color otherwise inherits down as a fixed
// value from wherever it's declared, so a descendant page toggling `data-theme`
// on its own root doesn't repaint text colored by an ancestor -- it has to
// sit here, at the same level as `text-foreground` itself.

// hostScheme (useHostScheme, shared with Chatbot.vue's own instance) so this
// root doesn't independently resolve OS-preference-only when embedded --
// see the long comment on useHostScheme for why a plain, unrelated night theme
// here would otherwise leak into the panel's own CSS custom properties.

    // whose *computed* background is transparent still needs the browser to
    // paint something behind it, and without an explicit color-scheme the
    // UA default for that fallback paint is white regardless of our own
    // dark class -- invisible on embed's own light theme (close enough to
    // white already) but a stray white margin around the widget on any
    // dark-mode host page. Reactive to `scheme`, not just the initial
    // ?theme= query value baked into pages/embed.vue's hostTheme, so it
    // still flips correctly if the host toggles its own theme mid-session.
