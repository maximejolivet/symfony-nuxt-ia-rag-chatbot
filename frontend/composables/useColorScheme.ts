// its own -- can resolve a *different* scheme than the embedded panel next

// this from public/widget.js's ?theme= query param and its live postMessage)

// preference instead. Since --background &co. are CSS custom properties
// only ever redefined at `:root` and `[data-theme='night']` (not also at some
// explicit "not night" selector), a wrongly-night app.vue root cascades that
// value down into any of the panel's own descendants that don't themselves
// carry `data-theme` -- even though the panel's *own* scheme resolved correctly.
// Sharing the same hostScheme input at both call sites keeps them in
// agreement instead. Read via useHostScheme() below; StickyChatBubble.vue is
